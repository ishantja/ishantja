- 🔭 I’m currently working on a hBand software that can control multiple haptic bands put on a musical ensemble to send tailored haptic feedback as a part of a vAIolin Aritficial Intelligence project
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about new and exciting robotics and machine learning developments with the advent of GPT models
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ROS2 Perception projects that utilize cutting edge algorithms in machine learning to make intelligent robots
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with software and hardware development of AI systems
- 💬 Ask me about my hobbies beside programming. (There are many)
- 📫 How to reach me: email: itamraka@umd.edu
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have (probably) hiked the evevation of Mt. Everest 10x. I love training for triathalon (🏊‍♂️,🚴‍♂️,🏃‍♂️) as it helps me cultivate a focused mind.
